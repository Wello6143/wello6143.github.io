      <description>Xem bản tiếng Việt dưới bản tiếng Anh này Welcome! It has been a while since the last time I built the first blocks of code for my blog website. But eh, the codebase was truly a mess (thanks to Hexo, bye!).
So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write (a lot of) things everyday, mostly about my self-study progress (about English, mathematics and computer) and my daily thoughts. It could be notes, sometimes.</description>

      <description>About Me&amp;hellip;? There is no Vietnamese version of this page. Trang này sẽ không có phiên bản tiếng Việt.
 Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Wello! A student, who is irresistible to find out how computer beep-booping.
Some words about myself Well, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much to talk about myself, though.
I&amp;rsquo;m a half-weeb, because I sometimes watch anime, just for fun.
I&amp;rsquo;m a both Windows and Linux user. Linux is always the best operating system that I loves the most, but it&amp;rsquo;s still somehow not very good for the desktop, where Windows is doing pretty fine.</description>
